## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Sass preprocessor
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM methodology

### What I learned
* Pixel perfect layout technique based on an image (without Figma design)

* Use of `form` `radio` button inputs for one choice selection

* Form `input` `radio` buttons custom styling from `label` html tag
```scss
& input {
    opacity: 0;
    position: fixed;
    width: 0;
    &:checked + label {
        @include radio-state($white, $orange);
    }
}

```

* Use of Sass Mixins
```scss
@mixin title-format {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    font-family: $font;
    font-weight: 400;
    color: $white;
}
```
* Use of Sass Mixins with parameters
```scss
@mixin radio-state ($color, $background) {
    color: $color;
    background-color: $background;
}
```
* Use of vanilla JavaScript event listeners to manage component state
```js
form.addEventListener('submit', (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const rating = document.querySelector('input[name="rating"]:checked').value;

    ratingTag.innerText = `You selected ${rating} out of 5`;
    cardRating.style.display = 'none';
    cardMessage.style.display = 'block';
})
```
### Continued development

* Use of preprocessors like SASS for styling
* Use of CSS Grid in complex layouts
* Use of transformations and animations with CSS
* Use of JavaScript for DOM manipulation and interactivity
